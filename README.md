# my-vagrant-provisioning
vagrant provision settings and bootstrap

@todo
- modify bootstrap to read the sql directory and load files from there.
- maybe parse out bootstrap file to do mysql install and stuff on separate shell script
- figure out a way to let the chancegarcia.dev stuff be more customizable. bonus for basing it from a pwd in Vagrantfile
